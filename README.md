# AudioScape Project Overview

## Project Description
AudioScape is an innovative desktop application that combines music production capabilities with real-time visual art creation. Users can create and edit music using a familiar digital audio workstation (DAW) interface while simultaneously generating dynamic, abstract visualizations that respond directly to the audio elements. This tool is designed for desktop platforms, offering a powerful and immersive experience for music creators, DJs, and enthusiasts.

## Key Features
1. Music Production Interface: A GarageBand-like layout for intuitive music creation and editing.
2. Real-time Visualization: Dynamic, abstract visuals that respond directly to audio elements.
3. Custom Sound Import: Users can import their own sounds to use in compositions.
4. Audio Effects: Built-in audio effects for sound manipulation.
5. Multi-track Mixing: Ability to mix multiple audio tracks.
6. Export Functionality: Capability to export finished audio productions and visualizations.
7. Customization Options: Users can adjust visual elements and their relationships to audio components.
8. MIDI Support: Integration with MIDI devices for control and input.

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: Electron with React for a responsive and native-feeling desktop application
- Audio Processing: Web Audio API, supplemented by additional libraries
- Visualization: WebGL, potentially using libraries like Three.js or p5.js
- State Management: Redux for managing application state
- Testing: Jest for unit testing, Spectron for Electron-specific testing
